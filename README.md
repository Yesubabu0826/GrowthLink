Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning classification model to identify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained using the IRIs.csv dataset and evaluates the most significant features influencing species classification.

Dataset

File Name: IRIs.csv

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (Target Variable)

Project Workflow

Load and Explore the Dataset

Preprocess Data: Handle missing values, standardize features

Feature Selection: Identify significant features

Model Selection: Train classification models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize best-performing model

Deployment: Save model and prepare repository for submission

Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in species classification. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and feature importance are analyzed.
